DMX-512 Project Summary:

This project's goal is to provide a maple board with low-level functionality
to communicate with DMX-512 capable hardware. This process uses several pins,
configured as outputs, to drive channel data at 250kBaud. An auxiliary chip 
is required to provide the differential signal (RS-485 physical layer) 
required by such devices. 

Future Work:

--A shield is currently in the design phase: schematics and layouts should be 
posted at some point in the near future.

--Work needs to be done to manipulate the functional code into an importable 
header and C file in a generic form.
