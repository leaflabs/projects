	-builds pymite and interactive pymite session (ipm) there is an error when you import modules in IPM. 
	-There are two variations here:
		-platform/maple: the Makefile will build libmaple and pymite
		-platform/maple_native a static libmaple library is linked against (PREFERRED)


TO BUILD:
	go into platform/maple_native
	Its currently setup for Serial3, but this can be changed in main.cpp This could possible be done with a -DCOMM_PORT flag for the compiler
		the easiest way to implement SerialUSB is to do a find and replace in the main.cpp file 
	modify Makefile SRCROOT to point to your libmaple directory
	make clean; make; make install
	when all that is done on the command line type (this will start the host side part of the python interpreter)
	../../tools/ipm.py -f pmfeatures.py --serial=/dev/<serial device> --baud=<your baud rate (I think 9600 for SerialUSB)>
	
	should be able to do
	print "hi"
	x = 4
	abs(-2)

	and other stuff like this, but it crashes when you try "import maple"


	there is some work done for a native library you can make a script (without import ipm)

	example:

	import maple

	maple.init_gpio()
	maple.toggle_led()
