Status 9/23/2011
	-cleaned up the directories, now there is only maple, and not maple_native
	-moved some of the debug data from the main.cpp file to a new pymite_debug.cpp file. I hope that it makes the main.cpp easier to understand
	-working on implementing SerialUSB and HardwareSerial with commenting or uncommenting #define statements but since HardwareSerial and USBSerial
	are two different classes it is a litte more involved
Status 9/20/2011
	-builds pymite and interactive pymite session (ipm) there is an error when you import modules in IPM. 
	-There are two variations here:
		-platform/maple: the Makefile will build libmaple and pymite
		-platform/maple_native a static libmaple library is linked against (PREFERRED)
	


TO BUILD:
	go into platform/maple_native
	Its currently setup for Serial3, but this can be changed in main.cpp with commenting or uncommenting #define statements at the top 
	make clean; make; make install
	when all that is done on the command line type (this will start the host side part of the python interpreter)
	../../tools/ipm.py -f pmfeatures.py --serial=/dev/<serial device> --baud=<your baud rate (I think 9600 for SerialUSB)>
	

	within IPM

		should be able to do
		print "hi"
		x = 4
		abs(-2)


	example within IPM: 1 second flashing LED demo

		import maple
		import sys

		maple.init_gpio()
		x = 0
		while (1):
			if (sys.time() > x + 1000):
				maple.toggle_led()
				x = sys.time()
