=========================
The Mbed Platform Project
=========================


:Author:    Dean Hall


Purpose
-------

This is a port of Python-on-a-Chip to the mbed rapid-prototyping board.
which features the NXP LPC2368_ or LPC1768_ microcontroller.  
In addition to running the PyMite VM in interactive mode (ipm), 
a subset of the mbed API is made available to the Python programmer.

The mbed board that is currently sold to the public is based on an
NXP LPC1768_, so there may be some differences in amount of program memory
and RAM between the two, but the VM is able to run on both kinds of mbed boards.
The LPC2368 is actually an older chip with less memory despite having the larger
numerical designation.

Building the Project
--------------------

At the time of this writing, building for the mbed platform on your local
computer is not yet supported.  If you are interested in building for the mbed
on your local computer, please monitor `Issue #22`_.  Instead, you must perform
the build using the mbed's `on-line compiler`_.  The Makefile in this directory
has a default target that creates the zip file for you.
Step-by-step directions to build for the mbed are given below.

.. _`Issue #22`: http://code.google.com/p/python-on-a-chip/issues/detail?id=22
.. _`on-line compiler`: http://mbed.org/compiler

The directions below assume the following:

- Python 2.6 installed.
- PySerial module installed (``$ easy_install pyserial``).
- Mercurial installed (``$easy_install mercurial``).
- Python-on-a-Chip tree checked-out or unzipped on your HDD
  (``$ hg clone https://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/hg/ p14p``).
- Mbed device on hand and website account established at http://mbed.org

Building:

#. ``$ cd p14p``
#. ``$ make PLATFORM=mbed``
#. Go to http://mbed.org/compiler
#. In the mbed on-line compiler IDE, click "Import"
#. In the file dialog that pops up, click the "Local Machine" tab,
   then the button to open the dialog box to choose a file
   and then select this file on your HDD:
   ``p14p/src/platform/mbed/pymite_mbed.zip``
#. Click on the "Compile" button; this should compile and download the .bin file
   to your computer.
#. Plug the mbed device into your computer's USB port; it should mount as USB
   mass storage device.
#. Copy the ``pymite_mbed.bin`` file to the mbed USB mass storage space.
#. Press the mbed's reset button (it will re-flash itself with the new binary).
#. Visit my p14p-on-mbed `Notebook page`_ to see the things that you can do.

Running ipm
-----------

The default sample project runs the interactive prompt, ipm.
Read ``docs/src/InteractivePyMite.txt`` to learn more about ipm.
Here is the shortcut (the path to your serial device will vary)::

    $ cd src/tools
    $ ./ipm.py -f ../platform/mbed/pmfeatures.py --serial=/dev/tty.usbmodem3d12 --baud=19200
