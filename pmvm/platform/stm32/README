==========================
The STM32 Platform Project
==========================


:Author:    James Snyder


Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates running interactive PyMite (ipm)
on the `ET-STM32 Stamp Module`_, which is an STM32 processor on a stamp-type
board.  The STM32 has an ARM Cortex M3 core.

.. _`ET-STM32 Stamp Module`: http://www.futurlec.com/ET-STM32_Stamp.shtml


Requirements
------------

Follow `this explanation`_ to build ARM EABI GCC tools

.. _`this explanation`: http://github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain

If you use the current version of this guide, make sure to edit
``src/platform/stm32/SConscript`` so that TCHAIN is set to ``arm-none-eabi``


Building the Project
--------------------

:Note: This platform does not have Makefile build support.

Run the following commands once to download files from ST Microelectronics::

    $ cd src/platform/stm32
    $ python update_periph_lib.py

Now use scons to build the project::

    $ cd ../../..
    $ scons PLATFORM=stm32

Now load the following file into your target's flash:
``src/platform/stm32/main.bin``

You should be able to do this using the `stm32ld`_ tool (among
others). If you already have this tool compiled and in your path you
can flash with this command::

    $ stm32ld <port> 115200 src/platform/stm32/main.bin

.. _`stm32ld`: http://github.com/jsnyder/stm32ld

You should now be able to use IPM with this port::

    $ ./src/tools/ipm.py -f src/platform/stm32/pmfeatures.py -s <port>
