 * \section dataXferIntro The PC/uC data transfer protocol
 *
 *  The uC data transfer protocol is a simple protocol to exchange data between
 *  a PC and a PIC over the UART. The example given below and implemented in
 *  this library applies to the PIC24/dsPIC33 series, though porting it to other
 *  microcontrollers is straightforward.

 *
 * \section dataXferExamples Examples
 * The following programs use the data transfer protocol, providing working
 * examples of its usage.
 * - dataXfer_echo.c, which is given above.
 * - dataXfer_demo.c, a more complete example.
 * - ledpwm.c
 *
 * \section designGoals Design goals
 *  - Easy to use: no setup required to send variables; integrates with
 *    ISRs seamlessly by using getch/putch rather than direct assignment
 *    to UxRXREG/UxTXREG. Receive requires setup and returns a non-protocol
 *    character read or a variable read.
 *  - Excellent error reporting: PIC defines the protocol, pushing most
 *    errors onto the PC. Timeouts on the PIC and PC help spot errors. The
 *    PIC reports errors via text messages, which flow through to the PC.
 *  - Reasonably efficient (> 100 Hz). Two bytes of overhead per variable (start, type).
 *  - Minimal PIC memory requirements: one pointer, one uint8, one bit per variable.
 *  - Can send/receive data in any order (not a fixed sequence): sendVar
 *    in any order, receiveVar receives any var (or even a non-protocol
 *    character, to make interaction via a menu work)
 *
 * \section errorCases Error cases
 *  - Timeout during received of a variable. In this case, the variable
 *    is only partially assigned; the PIC is reset, while the PC reports an error.
 *  - Sending in an ISR, which could cause timing problems. Fixing this
 *    really needs a trace buffer implementation.
 *  - Index of variable not the same between PIC and PC. The PIC names
 *    variables; the PC likewise only allows access to variables of the same
 *    name. However, the PC code will enforce variable name to number mapping,
 *    making this fairly uncommon (if the same name occurs twice, there's a problem).
 *
 *  \section protocol Protocol
 *  - \ref CMD_TOKEN varBits data
 *    - varBits = { v v v v v v l l} bitfield
 *      - v = variable number (0-\ref NUM_XFER_VARS, 63 = special)
 *      - l = length (1-4 bytes, encoded as 0-3)/special code. Special codes:
 *        - code = 0: escaped \ref CMD_TOKEN : this is the value \ref CMD_TOKEN,
 *          not the start of a command.
 *        - code = 1: long var
 *        - code = 2-3: Variable specification: data is size (1 byte),
 *          format string, name, description (all
 *          zero-terminated). Code 2: send only var (PC may not modify);
 *          code 3: send/receive var.
 *          - Only the PIC can send codes 2-3.
 *        - For all but code 0, data = varNum (1 byte), length (1 byte),
 *          data (of length bytes). varNum must be between 1 and
 *          \ref NUM_XFER_VARS.
 *    - For non-special, data is len bytes. For special:  see above. All
 *      lengths are len + 1, e.g. len = 0 is 1 byte, etc.
 *  - Sending a \ref CMD_TOKEN, whether inside a protocol packet or as a
 *    character not in a packet, must always be escaped with a
 *    \ref CMD_TOKEN \ref ESCAPED_CMD.
