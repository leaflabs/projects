====================
The Desktop Platform
====================

:Author:    Dean Hall


Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates running Python-on-a-Chip on the
desktop.  Any POSIX-compliant OS should work (Mac OS X, Linux, Cygwin).


Building the Project
--------------------

Start with a clean source tree.

If you are running on a 64-bit processor, you will need to increase the
heap size by editing ``src/platform/desktop/main.c`` near line 18 to set
``HEAP_SIZE`` to a value ``0x4000`` or larger that is a multiple of four::

    #define HEAP_SIZE 0x4000

The desktop is the default platform of the makefile build system,
so typing ``make`` in the root directory will build for the desktop::

    $ make

The default application is to run the interactive prompt, ipm.  
To run the host-side of ipm and launch the target-side type::

    $ make ipm

Read ``docs/src/InteractivePyMite.txt`` to learn how to run ipm.
