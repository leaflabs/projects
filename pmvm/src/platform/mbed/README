Purpose
-------

This is a port of Python-on-a-Chip to the Mbed-002_ board, which features
the NXP LPC2368_ microcontroller.  In addition to running the PyMite VM
in interactive mode (ipm), a subset of the mbed API is made available to the
Python programmer.

The current mbed board that is available to the public is based on an
NXP LPC1768_, so there may be some differences.  The PyMite VM has not been
ported to the newer mbed board yet, but it shouldn't be a difficult process.

Building the Project
--------------------

At the time of this writing, building for the mbed platform on your local
computer is not yet supported.  If you are interested in building for the mbed
on your local computer, please monitor `Issue #22`_.  Instead, you must perform
the build using the mbed's `on-line compiler`_.  The Makefile in this directory
has a **zip** target to assist in this process.  Step-by-step directions to
build for the mbed are given below.

.. _`Issue #22`: http://code.google.com/p/python-on-a-chip/issues/detail?id=22
.. _`on-line compiler`: http://mbed.org/compiler

The directions below assume the following:

- Python 2.5 or 2.6 installed.
- PySerial module installed (``$ easy_install pyserial``).
- Python-on-a-Chip tree checked-out or unzipped on your HDD
  (``$ svn co http://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pymite``).
- Mbed device on hand and website account established at http://mbed.org

Building:

#. ``$ cd pymite/src/platform/mbed``
#. ``$ make zip``
#. Go to http://mbed.org/compiler
#. In the left-hand "Program Workspace" panel, right click and select
   "Import program..."
#. In the file dialog that pops up, select
   ``pymite/src/platform/mbed/pymite_mbed.zip``
#. In the left-hand "Program Workspace" panel, click on the new "pymite_mbed"
   project.
#. Click on the "Compile" button; this should compile and download the .bin file
   to your computer.
#. Plug the mbed device into your computer's USB port; it should mount as USB
   mass storage device.
#. Copy the ``pymite_mbed.bin`` file to the mbed USB mass storage space.
#. Press the mbed's reset button (it will re-flash itself with the new binary).
#. Visit the `Cookbook page`_ to see the things that you can do.
