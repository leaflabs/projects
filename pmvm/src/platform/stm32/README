The STM32 Platform Project
==========================


:Author:    James Snyder


Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates running interactive PyMite (ipm)
on the `ET-STM32 Stamp Module`_, which is an STM32 processor on a stamp-type
board.  The STM32 has an ARM Cortex M3 core.

Requirements
------------

Follow `this explanation`_ to build ARM EABI GCC tools

Building the Project
--------------------

:Note: This platform does not have Makefile build support.

Run the following commands once to download files from ST Microelectronics::

    $ cd src/platform/stm32
    $ python update_periph_lib.py

Now use scons to build the project::

    $ cd ../../..
    $ scons PLATFORM=stm32

Now load the following file into your target's flash:
``src/platform/stm32/main.o``
