Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates the use of PyMite on the
`MegaMiniBoard 103`_ (MMB103).  The MMB103 has an 8-bit Atmel ATmega103
processor with 128 KiB program memory and 4 KiB RAM as well as a motor driver
and graphic LCD peripherals.

Details
-------

This sample project wraps the MMB103's C library, ``libmmb103.a``.  The wrapper
code is in the ``mmb.py`` module.  Inside ``mmb.py`` it is easy to see that
each python function declares a native code block which calls a corresponding C
function from the ``libmmb103.a`` archive.  For example, the python function
``adcGet()`` calls the C function ``mmb_adcGet()``.  For the most part, the
python functions take the same arguments as the corresponding C function,
but the user will have to read through ``mmb.py`` to see what arguments each
function accepts.

The ``mmb.py`` module also declares a native code block at the top of the
module.  This is called a header block and is used to include the header file
for the C library.  Unless you are making your own wrapper module, you don't
need to worry about this.

The ``mmb.py`` module requires an initialization routine to be run before other
functions.  So you'll see in ``main.py`` that the ``main()`` function calls
``mmb.init()`` at the top of the function.

The ``main.py`` module contains the ``main()`` function that is the primary
program to run.  PyMite knows to run ``main.py`` because it is told to do so
in the C code in ``main.c``.

Building the Project
--------------------

Start with a clean PyMite tree.  The following commands build the PyMite
interpreter and the sample project.::

    $ cd src/platform/mmb103
    $ make

This will result in the file ``src/platform/mmb103/main.hex``.  Use your AVR
programmer of choice to program that file into the ATmega103 target device.
The author's defaults are set in the Makefile, so this programs the device::

    $ make program
