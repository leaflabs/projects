PyMite String Objects
=====================

Purpose
-------

This document describes the String object as used in the PyMite virtual machine
(VM).  In doing so, it serves as a design document for the PyMite developer
and a reference for the PyMite user.

Overview
--------

PyMite shall define the C data type ``PmString_t`` as the general type for
the String object used by the VM.  String objects are used routinely throughout
the VM and character strings are often passed between the VM and native code in
both directions.  The design of the String object is important both inside and
outside the VM.

Background
----------

The author has a history with the J2ME_ VM, inside which strings did not have
null terminators.  The author ported J2ME to a number of platforms whose string
routines required null terminators.  For these platforms, the solution was to
copy the contents of the VM string to a buffer and append a null character.
This solution slowed the resulting system and added to its memory requirements.

Object Details
--------------

The ``PmString_t`` data type shall represent a PyMite String object and shall
contain an object descriptor, an unsigned  16-bit integer to represent the
string's length and a variable number of bytes to contain the contents of the
string itself.  The bytes that make up the string shall have at least one null
character '\\0' (0x00) following the last intended character.  Python String
objects may intentionally contain any number of null characters, so in the
byte representation of the String object, a null character does not always
imply the end of the character array.

String objects are of dynamic length.  A string's maximum length is limited by
the heap implementation.  As of this writing (2007/04), the maximum heap chunk
size is 1020 bytes.  Up to eight bytes are used by the ``PmString_t`` on 32-bit
systems.  Subtract a null terminator and PyMite strings can be a maximum of 1011
characters.  However, when using Interactive PyMite (ipm), a string is packaged
inside a code object and that code object must fit within the maximum chunk
size.  So the effective string length in ipm is smaller than 1011.

In the ``PmString_t`` data type, a character array field is declared.  Since
C type declarations must be of constant size and an array of zero characters is
not allowed by some compilers, this field is declared as an array of one
character.  This has a nice side effect that when creating a String object,
the length of the string is added to the size of the ``PmString_t`` struct.
The "extra" byte in the resulting size holds the null terminator.

In Python, String objects are used to represent names.  Object linking is not
necessary in Python because name lookup is used to access external modules,
global variables and other objects.  This means that there are often two
instances of every String object: one in the provider object and one in
the user object.  A String object caching mechanism is implemented as a compile
time option.  The String object cache shall conserve heap memory by having all
instances of an identical String object refer to one common String object.

PyMite used to declare support for international character sets using UTF-8
character strings.  This is no longer true.  PyMite only supports 8-bit ASCII
characters.

Design Decisions
----------------

Inside the VM, string objects are used very often as are the numerical length
of those strings.  I chose to use a field to store the string's length as an
optimization so that the string's length does not need to be measured every time
the length is needed.  However, I do not intend for the string's length to be
used to determine where the character array ends.

The String object shall have a null character at the end of the array
of characters.  This is done so that PyMite string objects are compatible with
general C string libraries and can avoid the troubles explained above in
Background_.  Note that Python String objects can contain null characters
anywhere within the string and this may cause C string libraries to not work
properly on those String objects.

The choice to add a String object cache was easy.  Without it, PyMite exhausts
a 4 KiB heap during system start-up before any user code is executed.

PyMite dropped the goal of supporting UTF-8 characters because there was never
a demand for UTF-8 support from a user and the complication of UTF-8 support
does not justify its exestince.
