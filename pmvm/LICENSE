For commercial licensing terms, please contact the author directly.

Effective Licensing
-------------------

The cumulitive effect of the licensing above results in two intended scenarios:

1. The licensee may use Python-on-a-Chip (including the PyMite VM) free of
   charge according to the terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.
   This means that the licensee must offer his or her software that links with
   Python-on-a-Chip under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2 as well
   and make said software available for public download.

2. The licensee may purchase a commercial license for the PyMite VM by
   negotiating the license with Dean Hall (dwhall256@yahoo.com).  The terms
   of the negotiated commercial license allow the licensee's software that is
   linked to the PyMite VM to remain private if so desired.
